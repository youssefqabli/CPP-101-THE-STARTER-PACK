# CPP-101-THE-STARTER-PACK

## SHORT INTRO
C++ is a **statically-typed** programming language =>
Statically typed is a programming language characteristic in which variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time. This lets the compiler decide whether a given variable can perform the actions requested from it or not.

* It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language and is known for its performance, flexibility, and power. *

C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language =>
Meaning that it supports a range of programming styles, including imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming. It is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means that it allows programmers to define classes, create objects based on these classes, and use inheritance to define relationships between classes.

In C++, a class is a template for an object =>
It defines the data members (variables) and member functions (functions) that make up the object. Objects are instances of a class and can be created using the "new" operator. Classes can also be derived from other classes using inheritance, which allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

C++ also includes support for templates =>
which are a way to write code that can be used with multiple data types. Templates are defined using the "template" keyword and allow programmers to write code that is more flexible and efficient, as it can be reused without the need to rewrite the code for each data type.

*In addition to its OOP and template features, C++ also supports low-level operations such as memory management and bit manipulation. These features allow programmers to write code that is close to the hardware and to optimize the performance of their applications*

## CPP CHEAT SHEET

Data types:
>C++ has a range of built-in data types, including integers (e.g. int), floating-point numbers (e.g. float), characters (e.g. char), and boolean values (e.g. bool).

Variables: 
>Variables are used to store data in C++. They are declared with a data type and an identifier (name). For example: "int x;" declares a variable of type integer with the name "x".

Operators: 
>C++ has a range of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables, such as assignment (=), arithmetic (+, -, *, /), and comparison (>, <, ==, etc.).

Control structures:
>C++ has control structures such as if-else statements and for loops that allow you to control the flow of your program.

Functions:
>Functions are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of your program. They are defined with a return type, a name, and a list of parameters.

Classes and objects:
>C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the creation of classes and objects. A class is a template for an object and defines its data members (variables) and member functions (functions). Objects are instances of a class and can be created using the "new" operator.

Templates:
>C++ has support for templates, which are a way to write code that can be used with multiple data types. Templates are defined using the "template" keyword and allow programmers to write code that is more flexible and efficient.


# OOP's CONCEPTS YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "Objects",  which can represent real-world entities or abstract concepts. In OOP, objects are defined by their characteristics, or "attributes", and the actions they can perform, or "methods".

here is an example from real world:

## The 4 key concepts in OOP:

**1) Abstraction**: Abstraction refers to the process of exposing only the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object, and hiding the implementation details. This allows the object to be viewed as a black box that can be used without needing to know how it works internally.

**2) Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the attributes and behaviors of an object together, and protecting the internal state of the object from external modification. This can be achieved through the use of access modifiers like private and protected.

**3) Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class, called the "subclass", can inherit the attributes and behaviors of the existing class, called the "superclass". This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass can inherit characteristics from its superclass and add or modify them as needed.

**4) Polymorphism**:  Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond differently to the same message or method call. This can be achieved through inheritance, where a subclass can override the behavior of a method inherited from its superclass, or through the use of interfaces or abstract classes, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by concrete classes.
