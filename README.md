**SHORT INTRO**
C++ is a **statically-typed** programming language 
>Statically typed is a programming language characteristic in which variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time. This lets the compiler decide whether a given variable can perform the actions requested from it or not.

It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language and is known for its performance, flexibility, and power.

C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language
>Meaning that it supports a range of programming styles, including imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming. It is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means that it allows programmers to define classes, create objects based on these classes, and use inheritance to define relationships between classes.

In C++, a class is a template for an object
>It defines the data members (variables) and member functions (functions) that make up the object. Objects are instances of a class and can be created using the "new" operator. Classes can also be derived from other classes using inheritance, which allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

C++ also includes support for templates
>which are a way to write code that can be used with multiple data types. Templates are defined using the "template" keyword and allow programmers to write code that is more flexible and efficient, as it can be reused without the need to rewrite the code for each data type.

In addition to its OOP and template features, C++ also supports low-level operations such as memory management and bit manipulation. These features allow programmers to write code that is close to the hardware and to optimize the performance of their applications.

**CPP CHEAT SHEET**

Data types:
>C++ has a range of built-in data types, including integers (e.g. int), floating-point numbers (e.g. float), characters (e.g. char), and boolean values (e.g. bool).

Variables: 
>Variables are used to store data in C++. They are declared with a data type and an identifier (name). For example: "int x;" declares a variable of type integer with the name "x".

Operators: 
>C++ has a range of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables, such as assignment (=), arithmetic (+, -, *, /), and comparison (>, <, ==, etc.).

Control structures:
>C++ has control structures such as if-else statements and for loops that allow you to control the flow of your program.

Functions:
>Functions are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of your program. They are defined with a return type, a name, and a list of parameters.

Classes and objects:
>C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the creation of classes and objects. A class is a template for an object and defines its data members (variables) and member functions (functions). Objects are instances of a class and can be created using the "new" operator.

Templates:
